Matt,"Edwards, MBA",,,Jun 24,Client Strategy | Business Development | Innovation,"For more than 20 years, I’ve worked alongside enterprise organizations and global brands to drive growth through strategic business development, long-term partnerships, and thoughtful execution.  Early in my career, I saw firsthand that the most successful business development efforts weren’t built on aggressive selling — they were built on trust, understanding real business challenges, and creating solutions that delivered measurable results. That philosophy has guided my work ever since.  Throughout my career, I’ve helped organizations:  • Build and expand enterprise-level client relationships • Increase revenue through strategic account management and business development initiatives • Strengthen brand positioning within competitive markets • Turn complex opportunities into long-term partnerships  To further strengthen my strategic and operational foundation, I earned my MBA from Baldwin Wallace University, combining real-world experience with advanced business and leadership training.  What sets me apart is a relationship-first, results-driven approach. I’m entrepreneurial by nature, creative in problem solving, and relentless in follow-through — always focused on delivering value for clients, not just closing deals.  If you’re navigating growth challenges, exploring new opportunities, or simply want to connect and exchange ideas, feel free to send me a message. I’m always open to thoughtful conversations.",Software Development,27587,"Wake Forest, North Carolina, United States",[RymarGroup],[OTHER:thinkmattedwards.com],[SKYPE:edwardsmatt]
