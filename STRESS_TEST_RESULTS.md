# 🔍 SALESSHERPA STRESS TEST - McKinsey Framework #10
*"AI sales assistant reality check"*

---

## **BUSINESS CONCEPT UNDER ANALYSIS**

**SalesSherpa:** AI sales assistant that provides territory analysis, prospect research, pipeline management, and automated follow-up specifically for B2B sales reps. Pricing: $99-299/month individual subscriptions, with enterprise team plans available.

---

## **STEP 1 — VIABILITY CHECK**

### **Does this solve a real problem? Rating: 7/10**
**REASONING:**
- **Real pain exists:** B2B sales reps spend 65% of time on research, admin work vs actual selling
- **Clear inefficiency:** Manual prospect research, territory analysis, follow-up tracking
- **Emotional frustration:** Reps losing deals due to poor preparation, missed follow-ups
- **BUT market saturated:** Hundreds of existing sales tools, CRM platforms, automation solutions

### **Will people pay for this? Rating: 5/10**
**REASONING:**
- **Individual reps hesitant:** Most expect companies to pay for sales tools, not personal expense
- **Budget competition:** $99-299/month competes with rent, car payments, personal expenses
- **ROI unclear:** Hard to prove direct revenue impact from sales intelligence vs actual selling
- **Enterprise potential:** Companies might pay for team licenses, but crowded competitive landscape

### **Can this scale? Rating: 4/10**  
**REASONING:**
- **High customer acquisition costs:** B2B sales reps are expensive to reach and convert
- **Churn risk high:** Easy to cancel if not seeing immediate results
- **Feature commoditization:** Core features (CRM, research, automation) available in existing platforms
- **Competitive pressure:** Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach adding AI features continuously

### **Overall Viability Score: 5.3/10**
**ASSESSMENT:** Solves real problem but in an oversaturated market with unclear differentiation and challenging unit economics.

## **STEP 2 — THE 5 WAYS SALESSHERPA DIES**

### **Death Scenario 1: Market Risk - "Reps won't pay personally"**
**What happens:** Individual sales reps refuse to pay $99-299/month from personal funds, expect company to provide tools  
**Likelihood:** HIGH  
**Why:** Sales tools traditionally purchased by companies, not individual expense  
**Prevention:** Pivot to enterprise B2B sales, demonstrate ROI to sales managers

### **Death Scenario 2: Execution Risk - "Data quality not good enough for sales decisions"**
**What happens:** AI provides inaccurate prospect information, reps make bad calls, lose deals, blame SalesSherpa  
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Why:** Sales data is complex, constantly changing, high stakes for accuracy  
**Prevention:** Multiple data sources, confidence scoring, human verification layer

### **Death Scenario 3: Competition Risk - "Salesforce crushes us with Einstein AI"**
**What happens:** Major CRM platforms add similar AI features, customers prefer integrated solutions  
**Likelihood:** HIGH  
**Why:** Salesforce, HubSpot have resources, existing customer base, integration advantages  
**Prevention:** Focus on features big platforms ignore, superior user experience, specialization

### **Death Scenario 4: Financial Risk - "Customer acquisition cost exceeds lifetime value"**
**What happens:** Cost to acquire sales reps exceeds revenue from subscriptions, unsustainable unit economics  
**Likelihood:** HIGH  
**Why:** Sales reps expensive to reach, high churn in sales tools market  
**Prevention:** Referral programs, content marketing, freemium model, enterprise focus

### **Death Scenario 5: Timing Risk - "Market already saturated with sales tools"**  
**What happens:** Sales reps suffer from tool fatigue, resist adopting another platform  
**Likelihood:** MEDIUM  
**Why:** Average sales rep uses 6+ tools already, integration headaches common  
**Prevention:** Replace existing tools instead of adding to stack, superior consolidation

---

## **STEP 3 — UNIT ECONOMICS REALITY CHECK**

### **What would you need to charge?**
- **Individual plan:** $99/month
- **Professional plan:** $199/month  
- **Enterprise team:** $149/month per user

### **What would it cost to acquire a customer?**
- **LinkedIn advertising:** $150-300 per sales rep (expensive B2B audience)
- **Content marketing:** $100-200 per acquisition (long sales cycle)
- **Sales team outreach:** $200-400 per enterprise deal
- **Blended CAC:** ~$250 per customer

### **How long would a customer stick around?**
- **Sales tool churn:** 40-50% annually (high in this category)
- **Economic sensitivity:** Reps cancel quickly during budget pressure
- **Average LTV:** ~$800-1,000 per customer (accounting for churn)

### **Does the math actually work?**
**THE CALCULATION:**
```
Customer Acquisition Cost: $250
Monthly Revenue: $149 (professional plan average)
Monthly Gross Margin: $130 (87% margin)
Payback Period: 1.9 months
Lifetime Value: $900 (accounting for churn)
LTV:CAC Ratio: 3.6:1
```

**MIXED VERDICT:** Unit economics work mathematically but assume optimistic churn rates and pricing. Real-world likely worse.

## **STEP 4 — COMPETITIVE MOAT ASSESSMENT**

### **What stops someone from copying this in 6 months?**
- **Very little:** AI sales tools are commodity market
- **No proprietary data:** Sales intelligence available from multiple sources  
- **Low switching costs:** Easy for reps to try competitors
- **Integration challenges:** Hard to build deep CRM integrations

### **Defensibility Rating: WEAK**
**Why it's weak:**
- **Technology not proprietary:** AI sales features becoming standard
- **Network effects minimal:** Each rep's usage independent
- **Customer switching costs low:** Sales reps change tools frequently
- **Major platforms adding features:** Salesforce Einstein, HubSpot AI

### **What would make the moat stronger?**
- **Exclusive data partnerships:** Unique information sources competitors can't access
- **Deep CRM integrations:** Become embedded in sales workflows
- **Sales team network effects:** Team collaboration features, shared insights
- **Industry specialization:** Focus on specific verticals with unique needs

---

## **STEP 5 — THE HONEST VERDICT**

### **VERDICT: PIVOT (Major Changes Required)**

**Why not GO:**
- Market oversaturated with sales tools
- Individual payment model questionable 
- Major competitive threats from platform players
- Differentiation unclear vs existing solutions

**Why not KILL:**  
- Real problem exists (sales inefficiency)
- Unit economics can work with right model
- AI capabilities improving rapidly
- Market still growing despite saturation

### **REQUIRED PIVOT: From General Sales Tool to Specialized Application**

**Option 1: Industry-Specific Sales AI**
- **Target:** Specific vertical (healthcare, financial services, manufacturing)
- **Value:** Industry-specific insights, compliance knowledge, specialized workflows
- **Pricing:** $299-499/month (premium for specialization)
- **Moat:** Deep industry expertise competitors can't easily replicate

**Option 2: Enterprise Sales Intelligence Platform**
- **Target:** Sales teams at 100+ employee companies  
- **Value:** Team collaboration, shared insights, management dashboards
- **Pricing:** $99/month per user, minimum 5-user teams
- **Moat:** Network effects, enterprise integration, team workflow optimization

**Option 3: AI Sales Coach for New Reps**
- **Target:** Companies onboarding new sales hires
- **Value:** Training, skill development, performance tracking
- **Pricing:** $199/month per new hire for first 6 months
- **Moat:** Learning algorithms, personalized coaching, measurable skill improvement

### **RECOMMENDED PIVOT: Option 1 - Industry Specialization**
**Focus:** Financial services sales (leveraging Matt's FA experience)
- **Target Market:** Insurance agents, financial advisors, wealth managers
- **Unique Value:** Compliance-aware prospecting, regulatory knowledge, industry-specific insights
- **Pricing Power:** $299/month justified by specialized knowledge
- **Competitive Advantage:** Deep domain expertise vs generic tools

## **💰 RESOURCE ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION**

### **STOP INVESTING IN:**
- General B2B sales tool development
- Individual rep marketing and acquisition
- Feature parity with major CRM platforms
- Broad market positioning

### **START INVESTIGATING:**
- Financial services sales specialization
- Compliance-aware AI features
- Industry-specific data partnerships
- Regulatory knowledge integration

### **DECISION TIMELINE:**
- **Next 30 days:** Validate financial services specialization
- **Day 31:** Choose specific industry pivot or kill project
- **No more general sales tool development**

---

## **🚨 BRUTAL BOTTOM LINE**

**SalesSherpa as currently conceived will likely fail** due to market saturation, unclear differentiation, and competitive pressure from major platforms. The core insight (sales reps need better tools) is valid, but the approach needs fundamental restructuring.

**Recommendation:** Pivot to industry specialization (financial services) leveraging Matt's domain expertise, or reallocate resources to higher-probability projects (CallCircle, Tambo).

**Matt's $100K rule applied:** Don't invest more in general sales tool development. Either specialize dramatically or kill the project in favor of better opportunities.

| **CallCircle** | 7.0/10 | GO with modifications | High |
| **SalesSherpa** | 5.3/10 | PIVOT required | Medium |
