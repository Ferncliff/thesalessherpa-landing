# TheSalesSherpa User Onboarding Guide

## **Step 1: Export Your LinkedIn Connections**

*Most users struggle with this step - LinkedIn frequently changes export options*

### **Method 1: Sales Navigator Export (Limited)**
*Note: Sales Navigator interface typically shows "Leads" and "Accounts" tabs, not "People"*

1. Go to **Sales Navigator** → **Leads** tab
2. Click **"All Filters"**
3. Under **"Relationship"** → Select **"1st connections"** 
4. This shows only leads you're connected to (subset of full network)
5. Click **"Export"** button if available
6. Download CSV file

**Limitation:** This only captures prospects in your lead lists, not your full network

### **Method 2: LinkedIn Mobile App**
1. Open **LinkedIn mobile app** 
2. Navigate to **My Network** → **Connections**
3. Look for **"Export"** or **"Download"** option
4. Save CSV to device

### **Method 3: LinkedIn Data Request (Slowest but Most Complete)**
1. Go to **LinkedIn.com** → **Settings & Privacy**
2. Click **"Data Privacy"** → **"Get a copy of your data"**
3. Select available data options (connections may not always be listed)
4. Request archive - LinkedIn emails ZIP file within 10-15 minutes

### **Method 4: TheSalesSherpa Browser Assistant (If Above Fail)**
- Contact support for guided browser automation
- We'll help extract your connections data directly
- Usually takes 5-10 minutes with screen share
