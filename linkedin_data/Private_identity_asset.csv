Over eight years at First Advantage, he has worked closely with Fortune 1000 clients navigating global hiring, compliance, and risk—developing a firsthand understanding of how enterprise buyers evaluate trust, consistency, and long-term partnership.   Earlier in his career, Matthew was a business owner advising founders and executives on growth and M&A readiness, supporting more than $100M in transaction-related activity. That experience sharpened his perspective on how leadership behavior, narrative clarity, and client trust influence outcomes—insights he later applied to enterprise selling at First Advantage.   In his current role, Matthew leads strategic enterprise accounts and guides clients through multi-stakeholder buying processes involving HR/TA, legal, compliance, finance, procurement, and executive leadership. Known for his preparation, judgment, and measured approach to complexity, he leads by example—setting a standard for consultative, trust-based selling that peers regularly gravitate toward for perspective, best practices, and guidance.   His impact comes from elevating the client experience, reinforcing high standards, and modeling behaviors that drive durable growth—without compromising trust, credibility, or culture.

Enterprise Sales Leadership  People & Clients Long-Cycle Trust       330-819-2604   matt330edwards@gmail.com   linkedin.com/in/edwardsmatthewj   Wake Forest, North Carolina   C O N T A C T H O W  I  T H I N K  A B O U T  S A L E S  L E A D E R S H I P   C A R E E R  T H E M E S   I believe enterprise sales leadership is less about driving activity and more about creating the conditions where people and clients perform at their best. In complex, multi-stakeholder environments, results follow clarity, trust, and disciplined judgment — not pressure.   My role as a leader is to elevate how people think, how clients engage, and how decisions get made.

Coach judgment, not scripts Enterprise selling requires context and discretion. I focus on developing people who can read situations, ask better questions, and adapt without losing credibility. Create psychological safety with accountability Teams perform best when they can challenge assumptions, learn openly, and still own outcomes.   How I Work With Clients Lead with curiosity, not positioning The most valuable client relationships are built by understanding how decisions are made, not by pushing solutions. Navigate complexity on the client’s behalf I help clients align internal stakeholders, surface risk early, and move forward with confidence. Long-term retention and expansion are byproducts of trust and consistency.   What I Expect From a Sales Organization Leaders who develop people, not dependency Clients treated as partners, not transactions Clear ownership paired with thoughtful collaboration Growth that compounds through reputation, not urgency   Where I Add the Most Value Managing complex, high-value client relationships Coaching teams through ambiguity and long sales cycles Elevating how organizations sell without losing humanity Cultivating confidence and trust   Enterprise Sales Leadership  People & Clients Long-Cycle Trust       DAYS 1–30 LEVERAGE CONTEXT & ALIGN TEAM Objective: Use institutional knowledge to align leaders, sharpen priorities, and remove friction.
