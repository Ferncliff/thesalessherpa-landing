Mon Jul 13 15:22:15 UTC 2020,SERVICE_MARKETPLACE,"Hi! I develop resumes, cover letters and LinkedIn profiles for professionals who are seeking new career opportunities in tech, med, sales, marketing and PR fields.    As a trained Certified Professional Resume Writer (CPRW) and Career Coach, I deliver valuable insights that capture the unique story of your career - documents that grab the attention of employers!      Today, most resumes never reach the hands of a real person and the ones that do are viewed in as little as 7 seconds to determine if you’re the right fit or not.

This is where the skills of myself and team come into play. We can help you get your foot in the door and in front of hiring managers with documents that are visually appealing, keyword optimized, and a true testament of your personal brand. I help early career, mid-career, executives, and transitioning military professionals land interviews across hundreds of industries and professions.     Why not save yourself the time and frustration? Hire a professional resume writer and avoid the top mistakes I see 99% of people make when it comes to resume writing.

Mon Jul 13 17:22:48 UTC 2020,SERVICE_MARKETPLACE,"Hi! I have plenty of experience crafting resumes for transitioning tenured client strategy/business development professionals in the tech/healthcare/business space seeking new succession.    Regarding new resume or LinkedIn profile development, I setup a process with the steps below. As a former recruiter for 10+ years, I am comfortable in understanding resume content/format/ATS relevance from the hiring manager standpoint.    I'll email information about services & the resume writing process. You send a current copy of your resume along with answers to my preliminary questionnaire contained in the introductory email. We setup a mutual time to speak about your background & clarify any outstanding questions on each end.    Once I receive the necessary information/payment, I develop the resume/coverletter (coverletter is included in the $265 cost) & will deliver the documents to your inbox within 5 business days. Upon receiving documents, you can email me any revisions for inclusion. You will be working with me directly. I do a wonderful job & my testimonials can vouch for my services accordingly:    mjwcareers.com/resume-testimonials    700+ LinkedIn recommendations, 8K+ followers on Linkedin, 100+ Google & Facebook recommendations, & have been writing resumes/coaching for 16 years    Thank you again for your time & opportunity.
