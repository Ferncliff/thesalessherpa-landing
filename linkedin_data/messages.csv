A few of our CLO's also mentioned First Advantage as a valued L&D partner so I thought it was relevant to reach out. We have a group of approx. 60+ L&D decision makers from F-100+ Healthcare & Life Sciences organizations coming together this May 3-5 in Boston, MA. (Abbvie, Advocate Health, AstraZeneca, Biogen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Hackensack Meridian Health, HonorHealth, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Multicare, NY Presbyterian, Parkview Health, Sutter Health, Phillips Health, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Zoetis & many more) who are looking to take 1:1 business meetings with best in breed HR technology and background screening providers for their top active projects over the next 6-12 months.   First Advantage's capabilities seem to align well as we're also working closely with HSI, ShiftHR and others however I wanted to hop on a quick call to learn more.

Could you share any details on your global annual spend for 2024, 2025, and your projections for 2026? For reference, the RFP from four years ago indicated an anticipated background order volume of 15,516 from Nokia, while this current RFP lists 1,675. This is only 11% of the 2021 figure and is the basis for this inquiry.   As a result, the estimated annual contract value (ACV) has decreased from $1.5M-$2.0M USD to approximately $200K-$250K USD in this RFP.   I’m asking because the ACV affects our ability to negotiate terms, and we want to ensure our pricing tier aligns while keeping our operations team informed of potential changes.",INBOX,

Now NW Corporate has a dashboard view (no PII) of what offices have screened to your requirements reducing brand risk.  Our annual conference is in Florida in April - a good opportunity for you, DJ or Shannon to learn from us and other clients.  https://offers.fadv.com/collaborate2026/   Thank you again - Matt Edwards",INBOX,

Following up on the meting we had scheduled in April now that the Toyota reorganization has settled a bit.    FA is THE category leader in background screening especially after our acquisition of Sterling 1 year ago. Much like Toyota in your category!   Quick thought: I have a new client that is moving to First Advantage from HireRight with the annual spend being over $2.5M on global background, drug and identity fraud solutions.  We have not completed the Discovery/Implementation process yet – but – I thought it might be a good opportunity to hear from her what the differences are, why they chose to move to FA, and most importantly, her experience to date with First Advantage.  It is a very well know brand in commercial real estate with a global footprint.  Would you be willing to have a quick chat with her? Im happy to connect you directly.  She leads TA for US & Canada, and we will be rolling out globally  Finally, here is a link to the HOT topic of Identity fraud and our best-in-class solution. https://fadv.com/solutions/identity-solutions/  Have a nice weekend!

Quickly, we are a completely new company now that FA has acquired Sterling last fall and are well positioned to help gig companies with what you care about most: compliance, TAT, daily efficiency, and cost  I saw your blog with Checkr from 2023 and also understand Taskrabbit is expanding globally.  First Advantage has 10,000 employees (compared to ~750) including 25+ on staff global compliance experts and named customer success directors for each region you may expand to.  We are (and have been) purposefully built to support brands like Taskrabbit globally.  FA (legacy) has had a similar solution to Assess that has been hard at work globally for 2/3 of the Fortune 100.  It appears things ended in '22/'23 with Sterling but I assure you the new combined company, and my division in particular, are specifically built for gig companies looking for speed and global compliance.  As a leader in the gig space, I hope you will consider an informational visit with my President Joelle Smith. https://www.linkedin.com/in/joellesmith1/ (she has asked me to reach out :) ) Thank you - take care! About FA adjudication: 1.	Global Compliance Leadership FA supports 200+ countries, including GDPR and local regulations, making it ideal for multinational organizations. 2.	Enterprise Workflow Integration FA integrates adjudication with I-9, E-Verify+, WOTC, and onboarding platforms, creating a seamless experience for HR teams. 3.	Advanced Adjudication Framework FA provides customizable adjudication grids for complex, multi-jurisdictional hiring scenarios, supported by AI-driven alerts and manual oversight for nuanced cases. 4.	Privacy & Data Security FA enforces SSN redaction, secure document handling, and compliance with international privacy laws—critical for enterprise risk management. 5.

I’ve been helping people find the right franchise for 20 years. There’s a new trend in franchising allowing you to be either a fully absentee or semi absentee manager. This allows you to continue with your current career while becoming more financially independent. The business will produce a monthly income stream, build an asset all while being managed by the franchisor or by you as a semi-absentee manager.        Would you be interested in hearing more about how these types of franchises would work for you?

I hope it is suitable.  Thanks,  Matt  http://www.linkedin.com/recs/received  ""[This recommendation does not come as someone that has worked with Russ directly but as someone that was with him more than my family for two years during our EMBA journey]   Russ was a tremendous asset to our class and was a great partner to have in our four-person cohort!  Russ is as determined as anyone I have ever met and it is easy to understand how he is such an asset to his company.  Even though Russ was the youngest in the group, he consistently added value and may in fact be one of the smartest people I know! Getting to know Russ over this time was a true pleasure and I am confident he has even more to add professionally now that he has completed this journey. Russ didn&#39;t need these additional letters (he has a lot!) to validate his expertise and approach - but now that he has worked as hard as anyone in the class... he is ready for the next step in his career - and deserves it. Russ - It has been a pleasure to get to know you and call you a friend.  Thank you for the patience, your legendary &quot;math&quot; skills, the many laughs, and most importantly not using your wrestling expertise to turn me into a pretzel during our journey!""",INBOX,

Let me get to work with Blake Squires and get an introduction between you two. He’s a super guy and may be able to help with insights on Validic or other.  I’ve been talking to him about rekindling SimpleCare with Validic but that is down the road a bit and entrepreneurial.   Let’s see if I can stir anything else up that’s a little more mature too.  Be right back! Ha,INBOX,

Great to hear from you!  Hope you are doing well!    I know about Validic and had met Drew a number of years back but not that close to him.  I have not been keeping up with them, but sounds like they have continued to evolved to focus more on healthcare market and have added AI analytics to their data streams. Interesting.    I am currently searching for my next gig, but like you I am not looking for something early stage entrepreneurial as I have 2 in college and 1 a year away.  It would be interesting to hear more about what you were thinking here on the play with them. Definitely think my background could benefit what they are working on.   Want to connect this week or next to catch up?  -Brian",INBOX,

It’s been a while since we originally met at UA talking about SimpleCare and how to bring providers into the prevention game as a means to earn loyalty.  I am not certain but thought you might be looking for your next adventure - with that in mind I wanted to reach out.  I’ve had to put my entrepreneurial spirit to the side with two daughters in or about to be in college BUT I see your comments and thought I would touch base in case this is helpful.  A few guys I’ve run across in my journey are Blake Squires and Drew Schiller. Drew started Validic many years ago and Blake is on his Board. I’ve known Blake since our high school days and can’t say enough about both guys.  Maybe reach out to them and let them know our paths crossed during your time at UA and mine at the Cleveland Clinic.  I’d love to make a run at white labeling prevention for health systems and payouts and there may be a conversation to have.  - Matt Edwards ,INBOX,

I saw your LinkedIn post about Biz Dev and would love to throw my hat in the ring - as I am a HUGE UA Fan - but we just moved to Raleigh, NC and that would be a long commute to Austin.  It did however get me thinking that we never did get to see the health care solution through as much as I would have liked given Robin & Brent left and I could not seem to make much progress with Warren.   As you are considering options for business development growth, I would like nothing more than to re-visit what I believe could be a unique health care related model and a way to generate Connected Fitness revenue while connecting with new consumers who need UA shirts and shoes.  I am sure you are quite busy - but - would be happy to come out to visit for lunch, catch up and see if timing might be better for a dive into how to influence the health and well being of many while further driving the UA brand as far and wide as possible.  Best wishes for continued success.  Thank you -  Matt Edwards 330-819-2604",INBOX,

I want to apologize for that process - I was trying to move many mountains internally - and ironically, leaders from both sides are no longer at each company!  We have a new President who is outstanding!  I see you are at LinkedIn - I hope that is going well - and we would love to tell our story to LinkedIn now that our acquisition of Sterling is complete. We are now the LinkedIn or Workday of our space, and I can put together a meaningful incentive to cover the change management needed to have LinkedIn consider working with FA.  I PROMISE it will be a good experience and I would get the best of the best assigned.

I am Matt Edwards from First Advantage and wanted to reach out to ask if you would be willing to meet our President, Joelle Smith ( https://fadv.com/leadership-team/joelle-smith/ ) about your global background screening program. Joelle has been with FA in charge of product innovation for years.   We worked with Andrew Abad (Andrew is outstanding!) back in 2021 & 2022. And 2 years ago almost to the day, 😥 we received a notice from Workday to terminate our contract for convenience, just before going live with you all. We had at least sixty meetings and were ~95% complete with work!  The senior leaders that were involved in that project at FA and Workday at the time, are no longer at each company and we would love to revisit what would be required from Workday to re-earn your trust. I have reached out unsuccessfully to Andrew over the years and am hoping you and team will consider a chat with Joelle.  Finally, there is now one true industry leader that is the largest provider with more people and tech innovation to support you than the rest. Why? First Advantage, has completed the acquisition of Sterling, the second largest provider in our space. This is industry altering! We are quite familiar with HireRight and can provide a significant incentive to offset change management if you were to revisit working with FA.  Thank you for your consideration.

I am Matt Edwards from First Advantage and wanted to reach out to ask if you would be willing to talk to our President, Joelle Smith ( https://fadv.com/leadership-team/joelle-smith/ ) about your global background screening program.  Joelle has been with FA in charge of product innovation for years.   We worked with Andrew Abad (Andrew is outstanding!) back in 2021 & 2022. And 2 years ago almost to the day, 😥 we received a notice from Workday to terminate our contract just before going live with you all.  We had at least sixty meetings and were ~95% complete with work!  All of the senior leaders that were involved in that project at FA and Workday are no longer at each company and we would love to revisit what would be required from Workday to re-earn your trust.  I have reached out unsuccessfully to Andrew over the years and am hoping you and team will consider a chat with Joelle.  Finally, there is now one true industry leader that is the largest provider with more people and tech innovation to support you than the rest. Why? First Advantage, has completed the acquisition of Sterling, the second largest provider in our space. This is industry altering!  We are quite familiar with HireRight and can provide a significant incentive to offset change management if you were to revisit working with FA.   https://www.linkedin.com/posts/first-advantage_wearefa-activity-7262909301076193281-t4Fz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop",INBOX,

To Mansi: ""It has been quite some time since your Jan 2019 response below to my inquiry about background screening services.  A lot has changed in our industry since then including First Advantage announcing the acquisition of our largest competitor, Sterling in the spring.    We would like to discuss how we can create a proactive, standardized, data driven and always optimized background screening program for SCI. We have leading technology and a staff of Customer Success experts that would be assigned to your account.  Three quick items: 1.	As mentioned, we announced the acquisition of Sterling earlier this year and anticipate it to be complete in 4Q. •	We will soon be the largest provider in our space by a wide margin with the ability to spend more on technology innovation / customer service than most of our competitors will net annually. 2.	We have a data analytics tool – Insight Advantage – that gives you and your dedicated Customer Success Director(s) access to real time data so we can PROACTIVELY manage the balance of spend, turnaround time, and risk management. 3.	We are offering an incentive for 1Q’25: Sign up with First Advantage in 2024 and receive 50% off background screening in Q1’25  Please consider a 30-minute non-binding discussion to talk about how we can improve your value, turnaround time and customer support.""

Following up on outreach made by your team who asked to learn a bit more about First Advantage via our website.  A quick note to make you aware of significant change within background screening industry leaders. First Advantage is growing and thriving due to a tremendous shift in the background screening landscape.  Background screening industry YTD '24 snapshot: February: A major background screening company reversed being publicly held after only 27 months (+ layoffs & moving support to 3rd party) March:  https://investors.fadv.com/news-releases/news-release-details/first-advantage-acquire-sterling-check-corp-22-billion-cash-and  April: A background screening provider in the Bay area announced layoffs that affected 32% of the company.  These are the top companies in the industry ...and as you can see... one of them is not like the others.  Many clients and former employees of your current provider are joining First Advantage. This trend highlights a broader industry movement, and we think it is crucial for Omnicom to stay ahead of potential risks. Given this change in our industry, my CRO Kari Marquis, has asked me to reach out because your brand cannot afford unforeseen risk and we are here to help.  In fact, Kari has given me the ability to offer a meaningful incentive specifically to Omnicom, to offset any change management that may be required by making a change.  Our contracts are not exclusive nor have long terms.  We earn trust, not contract it.  Over 1/2 of the Fortune 100 rely on us for their screening needs, underscoring our commitment to excellence. Let's explore how our innovative solutions can benefit Nvidia and create a standardized, data-driven, and always-optimized global background screening program. We have leading technology, and a staff of Customer Success experts that would be assigned to your account around the globe. Please consider an informational demonstration/discussion with your team. https://fadv.com/timetoswitch/   Thank you for considering us.  Have a great upcoming weekend!",INBOX,

Wow - time is FLYING! I'm afraid to ask how old your niece is now. I'm sure you've got great kids and Green is a great place.  3 kids at those ages has to add some excitement to the day. 19 years and they close the department ?? nice.  Let me know when you figure out your plan - I'll try to help any way I can if you want.  My road has been interesting. Had a great run in Dallas in telecom sales. Then wanted to raise my kids in Akron when Abby was 1, so started a m&a business here - did a few physician deals that led me to Akron General.  Started an innovations group within AG trying to monetize IP outside of the Akron market. Mainly focused on teaching other health systems how to build a H&W Centers (like the one in Green).  So I basically develop pretty large healthcare buildings across the US.  Also created simplecarehealth.com and got it to a point over four years where I was able to find investors so we are about to make a run at that.  That's how Raleigh fits in.  The Cleveland Clinic recently took over AG and didn't like that I'm employed and own the sw - and really isn't interested enough in any of this (they like sick people) so I'm starting a company to consult on buildings and run the software business. As all this was happening - we decided new school & a fresh start had to happen now or too hard to pull high schoolers out of school. SOO...we just decided to go for it.  (Pic of the front yard helped the decision). I hope all of this works. You may recall that I'm wired a bit tight...  Mom is moving to Dallas ironically to be near my twin (full head of hair) brother who has twin 2-year old boys! Dad & Cheryl are ok - not great. My sister Melanie is a bit of a mess and  it's wearing in them. Dad is still the same just a bit slower. How is your mom?   It really is great to hear from you - glad I hit ""send"".  One more pic.

I am currently looking for people that are interested in becoming a small business owner and/or current business owners looking to diversify their portfolios.  If this is not something you are interested in, just let me know and I will take you off my list.   I offer one-on-one Q & A calls with some of the top franchising experts in the United States.   The below three strategies are normally what we work with.  Owner Operator Strategy: Full time in the business. Typically lowest cost.  Executive Strategy: Manage the Manager. You are the C.O.O. Manage the Manager type business. Many who do this keep other jobs or businesses.  Investor Strategy: CEO type Executive management in place. Working on the business, not in. Least amount of time required by owner.  I would love to set up a time for a quick chat if you are interested. What is a good day/time and the best number to reach you?

My name is Matt Edwards - a new North Carolinian! I have recently moved to Wake Forest with my wife and two daughters and am looking for a professional home after leaving Akron, Ohio and my job at  Cleveland Clinic Akron General.   Today... I am taking a chance to reach out to you and hope this does not come across as too forward.  As someone that has been associated with UNC through lifelong family friends -and- someone that has sold health & wellness IP nationally to other health systems, the UNC brand of care is what I am hoping to associate myself with.  With Duke Health pushing into Wake County and all the other competitive pressures within healthcare, I am hoping that you would consider an introductory phone call (or coffee) so that if an opportunity arises, you would at least know who I am and how I can help the UNC Health Care. To date, I have not been able to gain an introduction within the UNC health system.  ""Why UNC"" was further driven home to me after recently interviewing with over 25 people within Duke Health for an AVP position within their Network Services Group.  As of last Friday, we could not come to an agreement but I learned a lot about Duke and further reinforced what I am hoping to find in a new home.  My passion is ""doing good"" through my business development efforts and health care to be where I want to spend my career.  I proudly represented a health system in Akron, Ohio and understand local, regional and national opportunities to generate revenue.  The UNC brand of care would be an ideal brand for the lapel pin on my suit!  Would you please consider an introduction?   Thank you, Matt Edwards www.thinkmattedwards.com 330-819-2604",INBOX,

Wrapping a care team for chronic or generally well people with disease specialists (if needed) that include exercise specialists and nutritions as part of every team. This was “white labelable” so that the care provider could gain brand equity through daily care and oversight - while connecting to patients daily. Tracking trends, creating accountability and earning a relationship in this consumer driven heath care world. I moved to Raleigh NC and had to pause the model - but - am as passionate as ever and would love to talk about how to tie virtual care to brick and mortar to earn loyally, improve health and reduce risk for consumer/patient, provider and payor.  Hope all is well!  Would love to talk about how to create differentiation in markets for providers that is message based remote care that hands off to telemedicine and/or on site visits.",INBOX,

I am reaching out after meeting with you back in September 2015 in your offices about a potential Health & Wellness Center model.  I can't believe how time flies!  Since we met, I have left Akron General - after it was acquired by the Cleveland Clinic and have moved to Raleigh, NC with my family.  I am now consulting with the former CEO of Akron General, Dr. Tim Stover on H&W Centers and integrating a proprietary software platform I have created to help health systems connect to consumers on a daily basis for lifestyle management (simplecarehealth.com).   Between properly positioned (and operated) H&W Center buildings and this software, we are seeing a way to differentiate health system brands with employers, payers and consumers to earn loyalty and connect with consumers for lifestyle needs versus episodic / reactive care. I really enjoyed my time with you and learning more about Lutheran Medical Center / SCL and was hoping to see where things stand today and IF you think there may be an opportunity for us to revisit our past discussions.    I hope all is well and hope to talk to you soon.  Have a great week!  Thank you,  Matt Edwards  thinkhws.com  330.819.2604 m",INBOX,

Triggers that automate notifications to CareTeam, easy to administer and customize for different conditions, and of course - wellness.

I'm not sure either are the right spot and the consultancy is doing well.  When you have a minute - I would love to hear more about your new role.

My recent experience at First Advantage where I have gained exposure to the WorkDay brand has me most intrigued about how I might be able to help influence the great work already being done.   After moving to Raleigh, NC a few years ago, finding a home in healthcare was more challenging than I anticipated and I have enjoyed my time at First Advantage.  However, the opportunity to marry my passion for doing good and working for a wonderful brand like WorkDay would be ideal.

I have left Akron General - after it was acquired by the Cleveland Clinic and have moved to Raleigh, NC with my family.   We finally chased the blue skies of North Carolina and are loving it!  I am now consulting with the former CEO of Akron General, Dr. Tim Stover on H&W Centers and integrating a proprietary software platform I have created to help health systems connect to consumers on a daily basis for lifestyle management (simplecarehealth.com).

Paul founded this business with the belief that there is a significant need for service and care during the loss of beloved family members and provides similar services for pets as he does in his traditional business.

Simply, they do not believe in Wellness.  The consulting model that we created in Akron - bringing our IP to other health systems in the health & wellness space - has produced significant revenue and helped many people in multiple markets.  We have multiple revenue sources through consulting revenue, developer partnerships resulting in fee sharing, long term royalties and as you know have added software licenses to the offering.   I am actively looking for my next opportunity to innovate at a health system and can not think of a better brand in my ""new home market"" than Rex Healthcare.  Representing a health care brand while trying to ""do good"" every day is very meaningful to me.  Would you consider introducing me to your colleagues within the Rex Health system?  I have reached out to Anita Watkins in the past but never heard any response.  I would also welcome further discussion around a pilot/partnership opportunity on the software and how I could duplicate the consultancy at Rex to add value to the overall Wellness service line.  I understand you are very busy but being new to a market and in transition, I thought I would reach out to explore if/how I can bring value to Rex.  Thank you for your consideration - I hope to see you soon now that I will be enjoying the Carolina blue skies full time.  Kind regards, Matt Edwards 330-819-2604 m",INBOX,

My name is Matt Edwards - I work with Doug Ribley in Akron and you may or may not recall that we have met a few times at MFA.  I am reaching out to see if you are planning on attending this year in Orlando with the hope that we can grab a cup of coffee if you have time.  I have spent a few years building a software platform for medical fitness - www.simplecarehealth.com with the specific intent of providing members / patients / consumers a differentiated offering focused on the Medical Fitness Difference.  We want to connect fitness, nutrition and health education as part of a coordinated care team for any/all conditions (chronic to general wellness).  I would like to gather your feedback on it if possible at some point.  My colleagues / investors have introduced it to Peter Ng and Anita Watkins at Rex because of personal relationships they have - so I thought I would make you aware.  The real reason for my note - please keep confidential - is that I do not feel I am a fit for the Cleveland Clinic mission/vision and have decided to move my family to the Raleigh market - we have bought a house in Zebulon and are very much looking forward to those Carolina blue skies.  I plan on continuing with H&W Center consulting - partnering with Dr. Tim Stover (former CEO of Akron General) and actively pursuing the SimpleCare software to help define the Medical Fitness Difference nationally as well as a smaller H&W Center concept we are calling Wellness Access Centers.  Again - this is quite confidential - but given that I am coming to Raleigh, I am hoping that we can catch up so that I can learn a bit more about how you see the industry, etc.  My wife and two daughters are always in the Wakefield area and have been in the Wellness Center there - they love it!  So if you have time - I am in town next Friday 10/7 and would like to see if you are available to meet, or hope that we can connect at MFA/Orlando this fall.  I look forward to speaking to you - again please keep confidential.  As you know, this is a rather small industry.  Kind regards, Matt Edwards 330-819-2604 m",INBOX,

How is everything at Akron General Partners in your leadership role?  I just was in communication with Denise Mirtich from your EMBA cohort who recently received a very nice promotion at Oswald.    Matt, I would love to have another strong performer from Akron General or from your professional network in our EMBA program.  Can you think of anyone that would be ready for that next move up that could significantly benefit from the BW EMBA program? Even if you have a strong potential candidate outside of Akron General or in a different functional role, a recommendation from you would be important for us.  If you recommend a candidate who matriculates into the BW EMBA program this August, we would provide to that student a $1,000 scholarship in your name.  Additionally, depending upon the credentials of the candidate we would consider him/her for an additional scholarship similar to what you received in the EMBA program. Please let me know if you have any ideas for candidates who could benefit from this program and you believe are the caliber we could consider for a potential scholarship opportunity.

I am aware that this place has been gutted.  I have no one to talk to there anymore - my investors are thrilled :(     Still GRINDING on this damn software - thank god I was bald before this all started.  I still think I can generate revenue in healthcare if they would just let me try it dammit!      I'm back in OH rounding out my time at Akron General - moved to Raleigh to start a new life there.  Seeing if I can stand up my H&W Buildings consultancy / sell software.  The timing has been tough - as these clients don't seem to be in a hurry to get started.   SOOOO... may be starting a search - which is painful as you know.  All is well though - 11 acre horse farm and three happy girls (wife and 2 daughters) ... I've got a beard and am down 25 lbs. ha!  I'm a damn farmer!    Now to get this professional part figured out..  hope all is well for you and your fam in NYC,INBOX,

I am hoping that with your experience at Duke, you may be able to assist me in navigating the process so that I have the opportunity to introduce myself to Duke.  As you will see via my profile, I still work in Ohio at the Cleveland Clinic but have already moved my family to Zebulon, NC to a small horse farm.  I have two daughters and a wife that could not be more pleased to be out of the grey skies and cold weather of Ohio but now it is time for me to find a professional home.  I can not think of a better place than Duke for that.  With all of that said, this is important enough for me to take a chance on reaching out to you with the hopes of a conversation with you or your colleagues.  If this is a common approach and is considered unprofessional or is an annoyance for you, please accept my apologies as I have never tried it before.   While my girls could not be happier with our newly found lifestyle... those horses eat a lot!   So I thought I would take a chance.  Thank you for your consideration.  Best wishes in 2017.

GradSchoolLoans.com is an organization focused on lowering medical student loan interest rates to make paying them off more affordable.  I am working with the CEO to identify candidates for the role, and your background looks like a great match for this company and opportunity.  Reporting to the CEO, this VP would build and lead the sales and partnership campaigns across multiple healthcare channels, and define and implement the strategic direction of the organization’s partnership programs.   There is little to no competition in this specific space, so the organization has the opportunity to be a very large player in this landscape, as well as become a nationally known brand in a very short period of time.   Would you like to talk for a few minutes so I can tell you more about the position? If not, would you kindly click the ""not interested"" button?   Thanks!

I have reached out to Kim to see if I can show a demo of our platform - now that we have it finalized and have moved away from ""wellness only focus"" to a pretty nimble condition management (chronic to general wellness) tool that enables wrapping a CareTeam around a patient/consumer.  Focus is for health care systems to brand this and take to employers / payors for risk reduction / loyalty / differentiation from retail offerings in markets.      I think you all have been focusing more on telemedicine but wanted to see if there was something that may make sense.  We are a one to one / one to many communication platform that is message based - I would like to see if there is a ""click"" away from FMH and telemedicine.

Do you even know what to do with yourself now?  It's like slamming on the brakes after speeding at 1000 mph.  I had difficulty with the adjustment, although it was much needed relief! My family has returned to normalcy.  My husband couldn't be happier for that.  I think he and my kids might be permanently scarred from the experience. Ha.  The spouses really take the brunt of it.  I'm not surprised at all that the second year was a bumpy ride because that seems to happen every year with Khuri, but disappointed to hear it wasn't as fulfilling as you expected.  We definitely had our share of drama which detracted from the learning.  I did okay with Khuri, but I understand why many have a rough time with him.  I worked for an exec that was a real a**hole, so dealing with Khuri wasn't far from the norm for me.  I wouldn't be shocked if Khuri departs soon.  Every year it seems like more drama than the last.  Your client respond well to the presentation?  Job is good.  Thanks for asking.  After the EMBA I walked into my new role thinking I could blaze a trail and really get the place into tip top shape rather quickly, but the resistance to change is unreal.   I feel well equipped with all the change mgmt teaching from Mike.  He's awesome.   Well, enjoy your day Saturday!  Congrats!

We are done!!  We just got our grades from Khuri yesterday and had the longest lecture of our lives from him this last Saturday.  His class was a disaster and at least 80% of our class has met with Dale and John about him specifically.  We got an A on our presentation but he manipulated our grades to give us all B+'s in the course.  He just couldn't let us have A-'s.   I got all A's except Tony... of course.  I personally had a tough time with him and wish I would have learned a bit more during this process.  We ""walk"" this Saturday and are all just getting our lives back.  Loved Peter Rea's Ethics course and appreciate Mike Marinis doing what he could do but Khuri hijacked the second year.  One of our teams got an F in the dry run and he stopped them in the middle of their presentation ... so we had the necessary drama.  Didn't really get the value I was hoping to get after all is said and done.  Everyone was talking about me asking to hear from your husband in the orientation and now we ALL understand what you guys were going through.

You're right in the thick of it now and it does get easier.  The most difficult period of the second year was November through mid-February.  Khuri doesn't give you the big picture overview.  He feeds you pieces at a time and it can be difficult to see how it will all come together, but it will.  I promise.  It's probably easier to talk through it, so give me a call and I would be more than happy to give you some advice and help you make some sense of the chaos you're experiencing.  Is Khuri having you each do your own industry report?  If so, make sure you're working on it in conjunction with the Capstone deliverables.   Leslie",INBOX,

Congrats on the ""not so new now"" job.  I sure hope you are enjoying your newly found time to be with family and friends again.  This is completely insane.  My personal note - please keep between us - is that I am looking for some input on your experience and any advice on how the hell to organize all of this madness that has come our way with Khuri.  I really don't know what to make of this whole process and frankly have become very underwhelmed.  IF and only IF -- you are willing to provide some guidance -- it would be greatly appreciated.  At this point, I have no idea what we are actually going to produce and how it will all come together to be reasonable. While I am trying to actually learn here ... not sure the teaching methodology and time commitment are making that as feasible as I hoped.  If you want to be removed from this request and not included in my panic attack - I totally understand - and you can just tell me so.  However, any insight would be much appreciated...

It’s more than simply a bike ride. VeloSano is a movement with the goal of bringing an entire community together to help one another.  I’ve joined the movement in VeloSano, and I need your help to raise money for the cause.  100% of the money I raise will support lifesaving cancer research at Cleveland Clinic and Affiliates.  The goal is to bring sustainable funding to cancer research by enlisting the passion and energy of thousands of people who wish to give back…  Thank you.

Seven elements sustained success: aligning nutrition, exercise, sex, stress, passion, and brain chemistry--and the key step missing in most other programs: partnering with a health buddy.

Congratulations on the exciting news last week and the continued success!  You may recall that I reached out to you a while back as a former Zips alum that is currently working closely with the Under Armour Connected Fitness group to create a healthcare related offering (Brent Drake, Brian Pitstick).  We are bringing many parties together (Cleveland Clinic, Akron General, LifeFitness & the American Cancer Society) to innovate around a one-of-a-kind population health management software platform for healthcare.  We are currently a UACF client and are working on arranging a meeting in Austin, TX hopefully by quarter end for a large group work session.   The purpose for this note is to determine if you have any time for a cup of coffee (or Swenson's!) while you are in Akron.

I was fortunate enough to meet you at the PNC Corporate event during training camp this year - I had a great time talking with you and am more proud of the Browns than I have been in a long time.  Unfortunately, my club seats - which I spend a lot of money on - have a suite behind them that has transitioned the from Browns Legends Suite  for the last several years to the Horseshoe Casino seats this year.  This suite apparently hosts the visiting teams' largest gamblers week in and week out. EVERY GAME I  now get to deal with the visitors degenerate gamblers for the game. It is as though we sit in the visitors section every week.   I wanted to bring this to your attention as I spend a significant amount of money on these seats week in and week out, only to have a suite full of visitor's fans ruining my game experience every Sunday - yes - even during wins. This has devalued my experience to a point that I felt it was time to send a note about it.  (We won the Saints game as an example and they were ridiculous).  I am not sure what the solution is but allowing a suite full of visiting fans to sit behind our hard-earned seats week in and week out is a problem.  We were heckled endlessly for the last few games and I think this unfortunately a consistent unintended experience for many of us loyal Browns fans that spend a lot of money with you. (suite 312 row 19).  We had decided to wait to reach out to you to make sure this is a consistent pattern - and unfortunately it has turned out to be every game. These people are impacting most of section 312.  Please have anyone call me if needed. Aside from today's result - I am very bothered by the value we are getting compared to other sections.  There has to be a better answer than having the type of people that frequent Horseshoe casino access to a suite - game in and game out.  This enables a few hours of access to heckling loyal Browns season ticket holders.  Many of us will NEVER step foot inside the Horseshoe Casino as a result of this.   I look forward to a better solution - This isn't working.  I have been pleased with most decisions made this season - this is just too close to home and is impacting my hard earned investment.   Please consider these comments - this is a serious issue going forward.  Thank you to you and your staff for everything! Go Browns!

Things are good here at Akron General - but busy enough my clubs are still in the basement - would love to get together sometime if/when Wade comes to town or otherwise.    Quick question:  I am looking to do a ""founder's walk"" of some sort at Fairlawn CC - and sell bricks that can be engraved with names/messages etc. for a walking path near our clubhouse.    Do you guys do that?  I would like to at least get a blurb or two for Belden to our membership if you can sell me the bricks. Any insight would be helpful or someone more appropriate to talk to at Belden.    Let's keep in touch.    Thank you,    Matt Edwards  330-819-2604 m",INBOX,

It has been an interesting ride since those days - moved to my hometown in Akron, Ohio to raise my two young girls (now 7 & 4) - wanted to try smaller town & seasons - and be near my family.   Ended up as a sales/marketing director in the financial planning space - tough market over the last several years.  SO deceived it was time to start my own business.  Partnered with a semi retired guy with 25 plus years doing it - teaching me the ropes. We closed several deals - many focused in the medical arena - for over $70M in closed transactions. Couldn't have been better out of little Akron,OH.   But with the healthcare I could get as a small business, self employment tax, long sales cycles, etc. Decided to go back to a bigger company to more easily provide for my family.  JUST was hired by the hospital system (started Monday) I did many of my deals with - a nice complement as they watched me for many transactions and created a position for me - which finally - since pre-Chip Data has me in a situation where I have a fantastic long term opportunity to build a lifestyle around for my family. Long road.   Sorry to carry on - but am very excited to find myself here after several long looks in the mirror over the years.  I wish you could have known the guy I am now compared to those days.   It sounds like you have been doing great since we departed CD - culminating in this MarkLogic position.  Tell me about it if/when you have a second.  I hope your road to today has been smoother than mine and there are good things ahead.  I'm at EdwardsMatt@yahoo.com  Good to catch up - take care  Matt  ------------------------  Thanks Matt...
