### Objection-Handling Scripts

**Objection 1: "My parent won't talk to a robot"**

- *"Medical alerts only help AFTER an emergency happens. CallCircle prevents emergencies by catching changes early - like a parent not sleeping well or feeling dizzy. It's proactive wellness, not reactive emergency response."*
