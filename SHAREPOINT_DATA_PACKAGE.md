- **Monaco-level intelligence** at HubSpot pricing
- **Partnership leverage** integrated into daily workflows
- **Prescriptive actions** eliminate prospecting excuses

### **Expected Results**
- Same rep, 3x pipeline velocity
- 90% time on high-value conversations vs 40% currently
- Partnership relationships converted to pipeline
- Quota attainment improvement across entire sales org

## 🎯 VP Demo Strategy (Feb 17, 2026)

### **Key Demo Moments**
1. **Dashboard Overview** - Real territory intelligence vs demo data
2. **Workday Platinum Widget** - "Here's our competitive secret weapon"
3. **Account Command Center** - Full WPP penetration strategy
4. **Daily Action Plan** - "Your sheet of music for today"
5. **ATS Intelligence** - "52 warm intro opportunities through vendor relationships"

### **Value Proposition Messaging**

### **Competitive Differentiation**
- **Not another CRM** - This is strategic account intelligence
- **Not generic automation** - This is industry-specific partnership leverage
