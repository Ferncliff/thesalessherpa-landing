# EMAIL DRAFT: Matt to Boss - Susan Bell/Rollins Request

**Subject:** Strategic Partnership Opportunity - Rollins Inc. via Susan Bell Connection

---

Hi [Boss Name],

I wanted to reach out about a significant business development opportunity that involves one of our board members, Susan Bell.

**Background:**
We've been developing TheSalesSherpa, our AI-powered sales enablement platform, and have identified Rollins Inc. (NYSE: ROL) as a strategic target. Rollins is a $3.3B revenue pest control company with over 20,000 employees, operating brands like Orkin and HomeTeam Pest Defense.

**The Connection:**
I discovered that Susan Bell serves on both the First Advantage board and the Rollins Inc. board of directors. This presents a unique strategic advantage for our outreach.

**Previous Interest:**
We had a prior engagement with Rollins a few years ago that reached the $1M+ opportunity level, but it didn't close at the time. Given our expanded capabilities with TheSalesSherpa, we believe there's significant potential to reopen and expand this relationship.

**The Ask:**
Would you be able to facilitate an introduction to Susan Bell? I'd like to:
1. Share our TheSalesSherpa platform developments
2. Reference our previous positive engagement with Rollins
3. Request her guidance on the best approach to reconnect with their sales leadership

Given Susan's financial expertise and board positions at both companies, she would have valuable insights into both organizations' strategic needs and technology adoption processes.

**Expected Outcome:**
With proper positioning, we believe this could develop into a $1M-5M+ enterprise deal, given Rollins' scale and our expanded service offerings.

I'd be happy to provide more details on TheSalesSherpa or our Rollins strategy if that would be helpful.

Thanks for considering this request.

Best regards,
Matt Edwards

**P.S.** I have comprehensive research on Rollins' executive team and strategic positioning ready if needed.
